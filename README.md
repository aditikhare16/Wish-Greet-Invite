This facilitates sending e-greetings, e-wishes, and e-invitations.

For each card, a customised message (appears on clicking the card) and an image (appears on hovering upon the card) can be added.

Suitable images can be added in the same directory as the HTML File, following which the image name should be updated in the HTML.

Customised messages for each card can be added in the JavaScript.
